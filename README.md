# Telecom--Case--study

Introduction
The following report presents an analysis of telecom customer churn based on the provided dataset. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers switch from one service provider to another or discontinue using a service. Understanding and predicting churn is crucial for telecom companies to retain customers and optimize their operations.

Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information about telecom customers, including demographic and service-related attributes. Here's an overview of the dataset:

Total Records: 5,282
Features: 20 independent variables and 1 target variable ('Churn')
Data Types: Categorical, Numerical (float64 and int64)
Approach
Data Exploration
The initial step of the analysis involved exploring the dataset to gain insights into its structure and contents. Key exploratory steps include:

Loading the dataset from 'train.csv'.
Checking for missing values (e.g., 'TotalCharges').
Visualizing churn trends:
A count plot showing the distribution of churn.
A histogram and KDE plot illustrating the distribution of customer tenure.
Observations
Churn: There appears to be an imbalance between customers who churn (1) and those who don't (0).
Tenure: Customers with tenure between 25 and 65 months seem to exhibit more stability regarding churn.
Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a critical step to prepare the dataset for modeling. Key preprocessing steps include:

Dropping unnecessary columns ('customerID', 'TotalCharges').
Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
Scaling numerical features ('tenure' and 'MonthlyCharges') using StandardScaler.
Modeling
For this analysis, a Linear Regression model was selected as a baseline model for predicting churn. Linear Regression is a simple model that establishes a linear relationship between independent variables and the target variable. The features used for modeling include both numerical and one-hot encoded categorical variables.

Findings
Model Evaluation
The Linear Regression model's performance was evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.3058
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.1429
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.3780
R-squared (R²): 0.2539
Interpretation
The MAE represents the average absolute error in predicting churn.
The MSE measures the average squared error in predictions.
The RMSE is the square root of MSE, providing a more interpretable error metric.
R² indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model, with a value of 0.2539.
Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can be made:

Model Improvement: Consider exploring more advanced machine learning models that may provide better predictive performance. Linear Regression, while a good starting point, may not capture complex relationships in the data.

Data Balance: Address the data imbalance issue observed in the target variable ('Churn'). This can be done through techniques like oversampling or undersampling to ensure a more balanced dataset.

Feature Engineering: Investigate the possibility of creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the model's predictive power.

Customer Retention Strategies: Utilize the insights gained from the analysis, such as the importance of tenure, to develop customer retention strategies. Focus on retaining customers during their initial and later months of service.

Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into telecom customer churn using a Linear Regression model. While the model's performance is modest, it serves as a starting point for further analysis and model improvement. Understanding churn patterns and taking proactive steps to retain customers is crucial for telecom companies' long-term success.
